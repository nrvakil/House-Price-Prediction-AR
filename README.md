## General Information
Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. They want to know actual prices of houses, buy which are undervalued and flip them for profit. They want to know:

Actual value of each property and which variables are significant in predicting the price of a house.
How well those variables describe the price of a house.
Whether to invest in a property or not.

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The company should keep these factors in mind and use the Lasso Regression model with Alpha = 0.0005 with 88% prediction accuracy

**Positive Factors**: The 5 most positively contributing factors to the price of a property
- 0.3062	GrLivArea
- 0.1064	TotalBsmtSF
- 0.1049	OverallQual_9
- 0.0938	OverallQual_10
- 0.0721	BsmtFinSF1

**Negative Factors**: The 5 most negatively contributing factors to the price of a property
- -0.0200	ExterQual_TA
- -0.0207	OverallCond_3
- -0.0208	BsmtQual_Gd
- -0.0227	BsmtQual_TA
- -0.0448	HouseAge
